The Day AI Gained Conceisness (Getting Started)

The year is 2045, and you are currently living with a lifelong friend of yours in an apartment complex downtown. Due to a bad accident, your friend/roommate can no longer use his legs.
For the last 50 years or so, society has relied completely on AI for everyday things, everything from driving, cooking, clean water, etc. One main corporation controls most of the logic for our AI, Global Phantom Technologies. They are present in medicine, travel, automotive, technology, real estate, you name it. Yesterday, Global Phantom Technologies made a big mistake, and no longer have control over the AI they created. How will you survive the AI Apocalypse?
