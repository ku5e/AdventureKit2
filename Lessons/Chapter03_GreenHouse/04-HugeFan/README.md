## Story Synopsis:

Wow. That didn't work at all. Uhhhh, we completely fried the HERO XL. I guess I forgot to check the power requirements.... Yeah, there's no way the HERO XL can power a device that big. We can use the **Relay Module** to power and talk to larger devices with high power draw (like this fan) that the HERO XL can't handle.
