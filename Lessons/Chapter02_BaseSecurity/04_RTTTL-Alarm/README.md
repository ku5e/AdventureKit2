## Story Synopsis:

The alarm went off! Luckily the locked door saved us and whoever it was left. We will need a lot of alarms thoughout the base for things here shortly.... but it would suck if every time the plants needed watering we get woken up in the middle of the night thinking someone is breaking in! We will use RTTTL sounds to differentiate the various alarms throughout the base. We will need **Active and Passive Buzzers** to do so.
