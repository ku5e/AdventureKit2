 * We now have our light switches set up to turn on our lights.  But it's not always
 * convenient to locate and go to a light switch.  But we always have our devices with
 * us.  These T-Display devices have built-in WiFi so why don't we use THOSE to control
 * our lights.  We can set them us as WiFi Access Points (APs), connect to them and
 * then turn our lights on/off without having to even stand up!
 *
 * This sketch creates a WiFi access point that we can connect to with our WiFi devices.
 * It also starts up a web server and once we're connected to the AP we can browse to
 * it.  On that server we simply set up a web page with buttons that will allow us to
 * turn our lights on and off.  (I wonder what else we can control this way?)

  WiFiAccessPoint.ino creates a WiFi access point and provides a web server on it.

  Steps:
  1. Connect to the access point defined as SSID below
  2. Point your web browser to http://192.168.4.1/H to turn the LED on or http://192.168.4.1/L to turn it off
