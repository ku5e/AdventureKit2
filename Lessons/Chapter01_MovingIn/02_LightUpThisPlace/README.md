## Lesson 2 - Do the lights still work?

While the walls at the old inventr.io site will give us better security, there aren't as many windows here so some of the rooms get pretty dark.

The solar panels on the roof appear to be producing current so I've wired them directly into the building electrical system. They'll only give us power during the day, but it's a start.

I've disabled the light switches that the office AI used to operate so we'll have to use the HERO XL to control the lights.

Let's get started.

The lights in the building are all efficient LED lights (can you believe they used to used to produce light by making a piece of wire glow?).

Let's wire up one of these small LED's we found as we build our new light controller.  Then we can wire the HERO XL directly to our building lights once we have it working.

 * A light-emitting diode (LED) is a semiconductor device that emits light
 * when an electric current is passed through it. LEDs are small, efficient,
 * and long-lasting, making them ideal for a wide range of applications such
 * as indicator lights, digital displays, and lighting. They are available
 * in a variety of colors and sizes.

/* Choosing what pin to use.
 * This project only needs digital pins.  So, on the Hero XL we *could* use any digital or analog pin
 * (D0-D53, A0-A15).  However, some pins support specialized functions and in later lessons we will be
 * using multiple parts, some of which will use some of those special functions.  So, let's start out
 * on the right foot by trying to use the most basic pin we can for each of our parts.
 *
 * Skip: A0-A15 (save for Analog),
 *       D0/D1 (used by USB and Serial)
 *       D14-D19 (used by Serial 1-3)
 *       D2/D3, D18-D21 (used for external interrupts)
 *       D13 (this pin controls the build in LED on the HERO XL board (LED_BUILTIN)),
 *       D2-D13, D44-D46 (used for Pulse Width Modulation (PWM))
 *       D50 (MISO), D51 (MOSI), D52 (SCK), D53 (SS).  (used for SPI communication)
 *       D20 (SDA), D21 (SCL).  (used for I2C communication using the Wire library)
 * Recommended for fewest conflicts:
 *    D22-D49

/*
 * Rather than use the same number throughout the sketch we can define the value
 * to a name and use the name wherever we would have used the value.  To indicate
 * that these are read-only, we add the "const" qualifier to the variable declaration.
 * 
 * While "#define" is often used for this type of naming it can sometimes have some
 * bad side effects.  Because of this, const is the preferred way to define constants.
 *  
 * Constants are often in all capital letters to emphasize that they are constants (though
 * this isn't required).
